# stem skeleton v1.0.0

a concept for organic software development and an awesome registry of stem skeleton stack upgrades

## concept

### stem skeleton

Stem skeleton covers the following:

* a greenfield bootstrapped from scratch project based on organic software development principles
* Several stack upgrades form the shape and abilities of a project, thus its stem skeleton

### stack upgrades

This is an boilerplate/scaffold generator which provides essential tools/implementations to existing project. Usually pre-seeded with user input. Example stack upgrades:

* backend api(s)
* backend worker(s)
* frontend single page app(s)
* development tools for building and/or deploying cells
* database support for existing backend cells
* database migrations framework

### cells

Having stack upgrades applied forms the stem skeleton shape and abilities of a project and its distinctive parts as backend api(s), worker(s), frontend single page apps(s). All of these are `cells` and are subject of organic software development principles and best practices.
